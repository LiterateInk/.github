# Code of Conduct - Contributor Convenant

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within our community, including but not limited to: code repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and all other forms of communication. Our goal is to create a collaborative, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their level of experience or role within the project.

## Our Values

### Inclusivity

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion, or gender identity and expression. We firmly believe that diversity of perspectives enriches our project and our community.

### Respect

Every member of our community deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Constructive criticism is essential for development and improvement, but it must always be delivered respectfully and constructively. Personal attacks, derogatory comments, and intimidating or degrading behavior will not be tolerated.

### Collaboration

We value collaboration and teamwork. Sharing your ideas, being open to suggestions from others, and working together to solve problems is essential to our success. Cooperation and mutual support are at the heart of our project, and we encourage all members to contribute positively and productively.

### Professionalism

We strive to maintain a high level of professionalism in all our interactions. This includes clear and respectful communication, honesty and integrity in our contributions and interactions, as well as meeting deadlines and commitments made to the community.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or any other unprofessional or inappropriate behavior.
- Harassing, intimidating, or discriminating against any community member.
- Insulting comments, personal or political attacks.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
- Posting private information of others, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission.
- Any form of violence, threats, or incitement to violence.

## Community Responsibilities

Community members are responsible for ensuring that their behavior does not violate this Code of Conduct. They should report any form of harassment, abuse, or other inappropriate behavior to the project leaders. We also encourage members to support other participants by reporting any inappropriate behavior they may observe.

## Enforcement

The project leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. In cases of severe or repeated violations of this Code of Conduct, the project leaders may take actions up to temporary or permanent exclusion from the community.

## Reporting Incidents

If you witness or are subjected to unacceptable behavior, please contact the project leaders at contact@literate.ink. We are committed to reviewing and addressing all reports discreetly and confidentially. The project leaders will strive to respond promptly and fairly to all reports and take appropriate actions to resolve the situation.
